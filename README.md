This helps give me direction on where to study each time i open the study guide.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. 

The best way to use this study guide is to right-click anywhere once you have navigated to the webpage. After right-clicking you will want to click inspect, this opens a DevTools console on the right side. There is a tab on the top of that page where you want to click "Console", this will navigate you to the console.log and you will then be randomly given a topic to study so that you can choose what to work on.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
